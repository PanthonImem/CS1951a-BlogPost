## Introduction
Wikipedia is a rich source of human-readable information on a vast variety of subjects. Automatic extraction of its content should prove useful for many data related projects. We aim to extract insights from Wikipedia articles on people (David Bowie, etc.) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. 

We hope, at least, to be able to classify a person into distinct categories (extracted, perhaps, using tf-idf) based on the content of his/her Wikipedia article. For example, the topics extracted from the database using Latent Dirichlet Allocation should give insights on ways to classify a person. We want to be able to tell, for example, based on the topic distributions if the person described in a Wikipedia article is a politician, an artist, or a singer, etc.

As probability vectors, LDA distributions also give us embeddings into high-dimensional space from which we can find embeddings into 2 or 3 dimensions for visualization. Then, if time permits, we may also learn to generate fake Wikipedia articles using Markov models and GANs.

## Blog Post 1 

Wikipedia put articles about people with listed birthdates into a list [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Births_by_century). Scraping pages off it gives us a huge collection of links, 1.37 million in total, to Wikipedia articles about people. One million is hardly a big number when it comes to data science. But it is a big number for the collective memory. Humanity really only remembers the big blots in its history like Shakespeare or Hitler or Napol√©on, and stars that just went out like Stephen Hawking. There are not a million people like those. To sift away the forgotten, we ask Wikipedia for page views which can be done by making a million requests like [this one](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/metrics/pageviews/per-article/en.wikipedia.org/all-access/all-agents/Fred_Rogers/monthly/20180101/20181231) we made for Mister Rogers. These numbers tell us where the limelight shines.

For those who asked the same question we did (with or without expletives), [Louis Tomlinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Tomlinson) is a member of _One Direction_. How he came to have 15 times more page views than his other band members remains a mystery beyond the reach of our intelligence. Taking data as fact, sorting the page views in decreasing order gives us the graph below showing a rapidly decaying number of views as you fall down the popularity ladder.


 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PanthonImem/CS1951a-BlogPost/master/Photos/page-views.png" style="width:95%;">

We took the $$n=10000$$ most popular articles as our subset, which corresponds to more or less about half of all page views in 2018. (Here, the top 1% do own half the wealth.) The cutoff at $$10000$$ is really quite arbitrary. But we want a small subset for two main reasons:

  - Articles with more views are better maintained, and
  - Most people don't care about the rest.

In addition to graciously providing views statistics, Wikipedia's API endpoint also extracts plaintext from Wikipedia markup language when asked [nicely](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=categories%7Cextracts&titles=Srinivasa+Ramanujan&explaintext=true&format=json&cllimit=5000). At this point, we know who we want in our dataset, the link to their page, and how to extract plaintext from it, collecting data is simply a matter of waiting for page requests.

Now, it has never been a matter of debate that the most insightful part of a Wikipedia article is the so-called [lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Lead_section). In our case, the lead section tells us what the person does, what they are known for and, in general, why they deserve a Wikipedia article. So for most of the projects in this blog post, we use the stopped-tokenized-lemmatized bag-of-words representation of the lead section.

### Keyword Extraction: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency

Altogether, the $$10000$$ lead sections contain 5461 unique words. To quantify the importance of each word, we use a popular keyword extraction technique called term [frequency-inverse document frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) (tf-idf.) 

The main insight of tf-idf is that important words should give information about the articles containing them. In particular, they should appear rather frequently in documents that contain them, but not so ubiquitously that they show up in every other article. The simplest of the tf-idf formulae articulating this train of thought is

$$ \text{tf-idf}(w) = 
  \text{frequency of } w
  \cdot 
  \log \left(
    \dfrac{N}{\text{frequency of documents containing } w}
  \right)
$$

Using the tf-idf formula above to rank the words gives us an expected result, which we show in the wordcloud below.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PanthonImem/CS1951a-BlogPost/master/Photos/wordcloud_bad_names.png" >
</p>

We can see the the most important words are names, which makes sense because important words should distinguish between articles. But not very interesting because we already know that these words are important. To counteract this phenomenon, we only consider common English words, i.e., words you would see in an English dictionary. This leaves us with 3815 unique words, the wordcloud of whose is shown below.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PanthonImem/CS1951a-BlogPost/master/Photos/wordcloud_bad_words.png" >
</p>

Words like "cave" and "pompey" and "vaccine" definitely tell us a lot about the articles containing them, but they don't cover enough of the corpus to give us a big picture. (If you read on, you will see that over half of the articles are about actors or actresses, but it's impossible to tell just looking at these words that there are any famous actors.) Upon closer inspection, these words only appear in very few documents, so their idf-weights are very high despite not appearing a lot. We experimented with other tf-idf formulae:

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PanthonImem/CS1951a-BlogPost/master/Photos/wordcloud_alternate1.png" >
</p>

After a few different experiment with weighting, we ended up with a method to calculate idf which wikipedia calls probabilistic idf.

  $$ idf(w) = \log {\frac {N-n_{w}}{n_{w}}} $$

where $$n_{w}$$ is the number of articles containing the term $$w$$.

### Similarity Search: Nearest Neighbor Search with 'Categories' Properties

From 10,000 most viewed Wikipedia pages in People category, 9,620 pages has 'Categories' property that can be accessed by requesting to Wikipedia API. 

To illustrate, Wikipedia has 'Michael Jackson' fit the following categories: 
'1958 births', '2009 deaths', '20th-century American singers', '21st-century American singers', 'AC with 15 elements', 'Accidental deaths in California', 'African-American choreographers', 'African-American dancers', 'African-American male dancers', 'African-American male singers'

Since 'Categories' property summarizes each person and focus on their occupations, nationalities, and ethnicities, we hope that we can classify people into groups using their categories already made by Wikipedia.

Firstly, we tried Nearest Neighbor Search to find the closest match of each person. In the data preparation process, we discard categories that do not relate to the person's identity. Those categories commonly contains the words 'articles', 'pages', etc. Then, we use a one-hot encoding i.e. dummy variable to convert categories into integer data. After the preparation, we have sklearn.NearestNeighbor fit the one-hot data and predict top two closest match of each person. 

In the first try, we have a dummy variable for every category that appears more than 7 times. The predictions of the 17 most viewed Wikipedia pages are as follow. 

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PanthonImem/CS1951a-BlogPost/master/Photos/untokenized.jpg">
</p>

To improve the predictions, we tokenize the categories and have important words representing each person instead. This is because we can create subcategories from the categories given by Wikipedia. For instance, with tokenized version, Michal Jackson will belong to 'American', 'Africa-American', 'dancers', 'singers', etc. Without the tokenization, Michael Jackson would never be matched to an American dancer even though they are similar. 

Thus, we tokenize importanct categories and perform Nearest Neighbor Search with the new one-hot matrix. The predictions from this try is more accurate.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PanthonImem/CS1951a-BlogPost/master/Photos/tokenized.jpg">
</p>

We also plotted this one-hot of tokenized categories hoping for distinct clusterings. The graph is shown below. 

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PanthonImem/CS1951a-BlogPost/master/Photos/tokenized_plot.jpg" width="450">
</p>

We might be able to improve Nearest Neighbor Search by adding weights to similar words. Apart from NNS, we plan to use the categories property provided by Wikipedia to classify people into groups. Possibly, we can present common features of pages that have high views by exploring the categories.


### Document Clustering: K-means Clustering with Doc2vec

We also experimented with document clustering. We first turn Wikipedia pages to numeric representations using doc2vec. doc2vec is a modified word2vec algorithm, designed to capture semantic information of a document. As an addition to word2vec, a document ID is concatenated to the input word sequence. The learned embedding of each document ID is the vector representation of the document.

Once we obtain the representations of all the documents, we utilize the k-means algorithm to cluster the documents. We ran doc2vec and k-means on the dataset of 10,000 Wikipedia pages. Setting the number of clusters to 10, we obtained the following results with doc2vec.

    </table>
</p>

Clustering allows us to better understand out dataset. From the table, we see that there are 6 main "categories" in our dataset: (1) sports (Clusters 1, 7), (2) royalty (Clusters 2, 6), (3) actors/actesses, movies-related figures (Clusters 3, 9, 10), (4) successful figures (Cluster 4), (5) politic figures (Cluster 5), and (6) singers (Cluster 8). From the wordclouds, we also see that the important words are corresponding to each cluster. For instance, the word "work" was extracted as the most important word in Cluster 4, which represent those best known for their career successes such as Elon Musk, Albert Einstein and William Shakespeare. Moreover, we notice that the dataset is highly imbalanced as shown in the chart below. More than half of the dataset are actors/actresses or movies-related figures, while only 3% are political figures. 

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PanthonImem/CS1951a-BlogPost/master/Photos/clusters_n10_doc2vec/pie_.jpg">
</p>

 However, there are some issues concerning our clustering. The first issue is a trade off between a large and small numbers of clusters. When we have too many clusters, some categories might be duplicated or very similar as the results we obtained when having 10 clusters. On the other hand, when we have a small number of clusters, a cluster may include irrelevant pages. As an example, Anthony Bourdain who was a chef was put in the royal families cluster (Cluster 2). While solving the trade off problem is not trivial, a possible work around for this is using alternative embeddings which better represent information about each cluster. As an idea, if we want to cluster documents based on occupations, we can build a neural network which enbeds documents and is trained to predict occupations.

#  Document Clustering: Spectral Clustering with Bag of Words 

To improve the performance of document clustering, we tried clustering socuments with spectral clustering. Instead of grouping points that are close to one another together like K-means approach, spectral clustering clusters points that connect to one another together. With many feature extraction methods including Doc2Vec and TF-IDF, spectral clustering with bag of words gives the best result. Unlike the result from Kmeans with Doc2Vec, this result groups athletes who play different sports. However, there is no group of royalty in this clustering result. 

The result of spectral clustering with bag of words is the following.
