# CS1951A Final Project

## Introduction
Wikipedia is a rich source of human-readable information on a vast variety of subjects. Automatic extraction of its content will prove useful for many data related projects. We aim to extract insights from Wikipedia articles on people (David Bowie, etc.) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. 

We hope, at least, to be able to classify a person into distinct categories (extracted, perhaps, using tf-idf) based on the content of his/her Wikipedia article. For example, the topics extracted from the database using Latent Dirichlet Allocation should give insights on ways to classify a person. We want to be able to tell, for example, based on the topic distributions if the person described in a Wikipedia article is a politician, an artist, or a singer, etc.
 
As probability vectors, LDA distributions also give us embeddings into high-dimensional space from which we can find embeddings into 2 or 3 dimensions for visualization. Then, if time permits, we may also learn to generate fake Wikipedia articles using Markov models and GANs.
